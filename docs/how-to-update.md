# Getting the latest code
Getting the latest code is important to staying up-to-date to the changes in the project. If you've been following the instructions from the ["New to Development?" guide](docs/how-to-use.md) follow the instructions as follows:

### Using Windows?
- Open the application **Github for Windows**
- If you have uncommited changes commit them
- Press the **Sync** button
- Once you've finished syncing open **Command Prompt**
- Type `npm install && bower install` to download your updates
